# Isomorphic Strings

This program checks whether two given strings are isomorphic.
Two strings are isomorphic if there is a one to one mapping that can be done 
for every character of the first strings to every character of the second string.

If you want to see the program in action download the repository and run the <RunTests> 
executable in the <IsomorphicStringsProject> folder. In case you want to recompile install the gcc compiler 
from this [page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tdm-gcc/) and run the command "gcc isostrings.c isotests.c -o RunTests".
